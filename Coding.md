# Coding

## TypeScript

Let's write some TypeScript together. Let's follow these coding styles:
* Strict Mode Typescript
* Prefer types over interfaces
* Prefer re-using / share types over redeclearing types eg `Foo["name"]`
* No `any` types
* Use Array Methods instead of for loops or lodash where it makes sense.
* Use Libraries: 'lodash', 'luxon', 'turf' where reasonable to do so.
* Use a reasonable level of fn abstraction keeping fn complexity reasonable
* Use best practices
* Avoid clever code
* Prefer early exits/returns
* Prefer async / await
* Prefer enums where reasonable
* With react, use useCallback and useMemo where recommended
* Use `??` over `||` for defaulting
